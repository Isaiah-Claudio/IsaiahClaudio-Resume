        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Second Year Biology Major at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently taking 3 classes while being involved in other organizations and other curriculars. I work in a hospital as a part of the program called COPE which allows pre med students to gain clinical service in a hospital setting. I also work in a research lab that looks at the structures of DNA and Protein to understand how Malaria is toxic to certain species of mosquitos. On my free time I am usually working in Lab, studying, at the gym, or hanging out with my friends at our apartment. I am a big fan of soccer so whenever I have the time I try to play or watch. I have many skills that are fit for job of Orthopedic Surgery. Some of these include leadership which I have much experience with as I have been captain of multiple soccer teams. As well as communication skills which are important in order to to communicate to patients and other doctors or nurses. Furthermore, one very important skill that I have is patience, it is very important in the medical field to be patient as not everything will go in the best direction. It is important to be able to keep cool and stay patietn when dealing with certain situations that are not ideal.<br><br>

        I have some experience with the medical field. For example, I have been a part of COPE which is a program that allows students to gain important clinical experience in the hospital settings. I have assisted nurses in helping patients, as well I have worked under doctors to witness certain examinations or procedures. More recently, I have been shadowing radiologists and CT techs in understanding how medical imaging works and how to read certain images. Working in this COPE program has broadened my knowledge of the medical field and has allowed me to greater appreciate certain careers in the medical field as well. I have also worked in a physical therapy clinic during my senior year of high school which allowed me to broaden my knowledge of the field as well and to help me understand that there are some careers that help even when not at the hospital. During my time at the physical therapy clinic I helped patients after their treatment with the physical therapist with Ice or Heat. Sometimes I would also apply electrodes for muscle contractions as well as traction for stretching the back and neck. <br><br>

        On campus at UCR I am part of a pre medical fraternity called Phi Delta Epsilon which is a great community of scholars that all have the same goal in mind, medical school. As a result of this, I am constantly surrounded by people who have the same determination and motivation as me. We all study together and help each other when in need because we all have the same gaol. There are students ranging from different backgrounds, different ages, and cultures. Despite all of this, we all have one thing in common, and that is the love for medicine. This love for medicine is what brings us all together despite our differences. We look beyond the superficial and take into consideration the true colors of someone as we all work together to make our dreams of becoming physicians come true. This organization as helped me in so many ways in terms of social life and academic life. I have come across some of the most genuine and intelligent people I have ever met and being surrounded by this only drives me to be the best I can be.
